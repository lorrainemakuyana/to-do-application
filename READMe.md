# To Do List Application 

I was given this project by my supervisor during my internship at CYST Company Limited. 

### Requirements 
I should be able to
* see a list of items
* add items (it should be uncompleted) by default
* mark an item as completed
* filter by completed or incompleted task
* delete an item from the list
* BONUS: I should be able to search through the list

All the requirements were met. Some were crushed such that the desing of the application allowed the requirements to be completed by default.

I learned about creating HTML Elements in JS and editing the UI with every click on links in the page. I utilized arrays and objects in the application.
